# Secrets-App
Node App made during the LAB Course with authentication/encryption

This application uses MongoDB w/ Mongoose to allow a user to register for an account, post an anonymous "secret" to a public board, and view all posted secrets.

It also uses the NPM package "bcrypt" to encrypt user information within MongoDB.
